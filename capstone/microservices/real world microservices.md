## real world challenges

principles behind microservices:
- distributed building of systems

definition: a style of SOA (service oriented architecture) that came after conitnuous delivery; fine-grained domain capability; independently releasable (loose coupling);

what it's not: not a monolithic architecture; layered and cross functional division are not microservices; intelligently integrated services are not microservices; centrally integrated through a shared database.

values: autonomy with responsibility: different teams have different responsibility and have autonomy over the service; you build it, you own it; rapid feedback cycle; small services are easier to change; scale operations is easy; composability of services is nice; ployglot environment; cognitive load on developers

Problems:
Communication between autonomous teams.
Problem of implementing and orchestrating distributed systems.
Maintaining a distributed system is hard; with polyglot environment, you need lot more people with different expertise to maintain.
