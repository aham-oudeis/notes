# Summary

The internet is a vast network of networks. It is comprised of both the __network infrastructure__ itself (devices, routers, switches, cables, etc) and the __protocols__ that enable that infrastructure to function.

__Protocols__ are systems of rules. Network protocols are systems of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data over a network.

Different types of protocol are concerned with __different aspects of network communication__. It can be useful to think of these different protocols as operating at particular 'layers' of the network. (Thinking in terms of _aspects_ and thinking in terms of _layers_.)

__Encapsulation__ is a means by which protocols at different network layers can work together.

Encapsulation is implemented through the use of __Protocol Data Units (PDUs)__. The PDU of a protocol at one layer, becomes the data payload of the PDU of a protocol at a lower layer.

The __physical network__ is the tangible infrastructure that transmits the __electrical signals__, __light__, and __radio waves__ which carry network communications.

__Latency__ is a measure of delay. It indicates the amount of time it takes for data to travel from one point to another.

__Bandwidth__ is a measure of capacity. It indicates the amount of data that can be transmitted in a set period of time.

__Ethernet__ is a set of standards and protocols that enables communication between devices on a _local network_.

Ethernet uses a __Protocol Data Unit__ called a __Frame__.

Ethernet uses MAC addressing to identify devices connected to the local network.

The Internet Protocol (IP) is the predominant protocol used for inter-network communication.

There are two versions of IP currently in use: IPv4 and IPv6.

The __Internet Protocol__ uses a system of addressing (IP Addressing) to direct data between one device and another across networks.

IP uses a Protocol Data Unit called a __Packet__.
