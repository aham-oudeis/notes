# Box Model

## Visual Formatting Model

### Block Elements
* Block elements group one or more elements
* `block` elements that group other elements are called __containers__.
* `body` is the master container
* a `block` element occupies all horizontal space available within its container, with nothing to the left or right of the `block`
* `block` elements use the box properties (`width`, `heigh`, `padding`, `border`, `margin`) to determine the size of the element

### Inline Elements
* `inline` elements handle the dimensions properties differently from the way the `block` elements treat them.
