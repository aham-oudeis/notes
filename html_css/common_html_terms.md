## Element
Elements are designators that define the structure and content of objects within a page. Elements are identified by the use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets, < >, surrounding the element name.

Elements are components of the HTML page that define the structure and meaning of the object in the page. For instance, `header`, `h1`, `p` mean different things in the html page. Although elements have some default presentation scheme, what is important is what they mean in the document. 

## Tags
The use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets surrounding an element name creates what is known as a tag. Tags most commonly occur in pairs of opening and closing tags.

An opening tag marks the beginning of an element. It consists of a less-than sign followed by an element’s name, and then ends with a greater-than sign; for example, `<div>`.

A closing tag marks the end of an element. It consists of a less-than sign followed by a forward slash and the element’s name, and then ends with a greater-than sign; for example, `</div>`.

## Attributes
Attributes are properties used to provide additional information about an element. The most common attributes include the id attribute, which identifies an element; the class attribute, which classifies an element; the src attribute, which specifies a source for embeddable content; and the href attribute, which provides a hyperlink reference to a linked resource.
* `id` attribute identifies the element
* `class` attribute classifies the element
* `src` attibute specifies a resource for the embeddable content
* `href` attribute provides a hyperlink reference to a linked resource
