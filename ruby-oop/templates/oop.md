# Object Oriented Programming

OOP (Object Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that was proposed to solve the problem of growing complexity in the code and the resultant difficulty of maintaining code. The specific difficulty has to do with the increase in dependencies in the program when programming large software.

Problem: if one piece of code is changed, there is a ripple effect throughtout the whole program; this is burdensome for the purpose of maintaining code.

> Programmers needed a way to create containers for data that could be changed and manipulated without affecting the entire program. They needed a way to section off areas of code that performed certain procedures so that their programs could become the interaction of many small parts, as opposed to one massive blob of dependency.

OOP seeks to solve this problem.

Benefits of OOP:
1. It enables programmers to manage the increasing complexity of large software programs.
2. Objects, conceived as nouns, allow programmers to think about the problem in an abstract way.
3. Reduce dependencies throughout the code base by encapsulating states and behaviors.
4. Enables a flexible way of developing code while avoiding duplication.
