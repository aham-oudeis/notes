###  Method Access Control

Method access control are ways of curating the public interface of  an object through the usage of _access modifiers_ in the class. Method access control enables hiding certain methods and making other methods part of the public interface. Ruby has three _access modifiers_: `public`, `private`, `protected`.

> A private method is internal to the implementation of a class, and it can only be called by other instance methods of the class (or, as weâ€™ll see later, its subclasses). Private methods are implicitly invoked on self, and may not be explicitly invoked on an object.
>
> Protected methods are very similar to private methods. The main  difference between them is protected methods allow access between class  instances, while private methods don't. If a method is protected, it  can't be invoked from outside the class. This allows for controlled  access, but wider access between class instances.

> A protected method is like a private method in that it can only be invoked from within the implementation of a class or its subclasses. It differs from a private method in that it may be explicitly invoked on any instance of the class, and it is not restricted to implicit invocation on self. A protected method can be used, for example, to define an accessor that allows instances of a class to share internal state with each other, but does not allow users of the class to access that state. (p. 232)

Example:

```ruby
class BankAccount
  def initialize(name, balance)
    @name = name
    @balance = balance
  end

  def >(other)
    balance > other.balance
  end

  private

  attr_reader :balance
end

bill = Account.new("Billy", 2957)
marvin = Account.new("Marvin", 38271)

p bill > marvin
```

The code above throws an error because we cannot call the private
methods with an explicit caller the way we do in line [] (inside the `>` method)
but if we change line [] from `private` to `protected`, the code
works, because protected methods allow access between class
instances from within the class.

```ruby
class BankAccount
  def initialize(name, balance)
    @name = name
    @balance = balance
  end

  def >(other)
    balance > other.balance
  end

  protected

  attr_reader :balance
end

bill = Account.new("Billy", 2957)
marvin = Account.new("Marvin", 38271)

p bill > marvin #=> false

```
