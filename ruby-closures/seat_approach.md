## SEAT approach

1. Setup          => Setting up objects required for running tests
2. Execution      => Execute the code against the given object
3. Assertion      => Assert the result of the execution
4. Teardown       => Closing the files after the tests are run

Minitest runs setup before and teardown after every test.
