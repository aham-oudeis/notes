## Core Tools

Rubygems are packages of code that we can download and use in our programs or through command line.

### Ruby version Manager

Ruby version managers are programs that let you install, manage, and use multiple versions of Ruby.

We need to use some kind of ruby version manager, because we may need different versions of ruby for different projects and we need a system for switching between different ruby versions. Two reaons for having version manager:
1. Since Ruby is constantly evolving and improving, some of our code may work in one version and not work in another.
2. In working environments, we may need to work with a specific version of Ruby for the sake of standardizing the code.
