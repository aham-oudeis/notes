You should be able to clearly explain the following topics:
* assignments and [comparison](implicit_coercion.md)
* [variable scope](variable_scope.md), especially how variables interact with function definitions and blocks
* [function scope](functions.md)
* [hoisting](hoisting.md)
* [primitive values](primitives.md), types and type conversions/coercions
* object properties and [mutation](primitives.md)
* understand the differences between [loose and strict equality](equality_operator.md)
* how passing an argument into a function may or may not permanently change the value that a variable contains or points to
* working with Strings, [Arrays](arrays.md), and Objects. 
  In particular, you should be thoroughly familiar with the basic Array iteration methods 
  (forEach, map, filter, and find) and how to use Object methods to access the keys and values in an Object as an Array.
* understand that [arrays are objects](arrays.md), and be able to determine whether you have an Array
* [variables as pointers](variables_as_pointers.md)
* console.log vs return
* [truthiness](truthiness.md): false and true vs. falsy and truthy
* function definition and function invocation
* [function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions](functions.md)
* [implicit return value of function invocations](functions.md)
* [closures](closures.md)
* [first-class functions](first_class_functions.md)
* [partial function application](partial_function.md)
* [side-effects](pure_functions.md)
* [naming conventions](idiomatic_javascript.md) (legal vs idiomatic)
* [pure functions and side effects](pure_functions.md)
* [strict mode vs. sloppy mode](strict_mode.md)
* [JavaScript syntactic sugar](syntactic_sugar.md)
