The object-oriented approach to programming puts data and behaviors that manipulate that data into containers for that data, i.e., objects. 

This approach allows us to move the complexity inside objects instead of exposing it globally. 

Maintenance is easier with OO approach.

Features of objects:
1. organize related data and code together
2. are useful when a program needs more than one instance of something
3. become more useful as the codebase size increases (maintenability)
