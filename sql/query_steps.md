## How PostgreSQL executes a query

1. Rows are collected into a virtual derived table
   * Database collects all the rows from the table referenced by the FROM clause, including the tables generated by the JOIN clause.
2. Rows are filtered using WHERE conditions
   * All the conditions mentioned in the WHERE clause are evaluated for each row and the ones that fail the requirements are removed.
3. Rows are divided into groups (if there is a GROUP BY clause)
4. Groups are filtered using HAVING conditions
5. Values are computed for the SELECT list of columns
6. Results are sorted by the ORDER BY clause
7. Results are limited or offset (if LIMIT and/or OFFSET included)
